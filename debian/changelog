mr (0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add "gitless" file to lib. 
    This adds a special type of git repository, where the .git directory
    is stored on a file server, to avoid wasting space with it on the client.
  * Revert buggy change to directory printing code.

mr (0.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add an offline mode. When in offline mode, mr will remember commands
    that failed (presumably due to lack of network access), and will run
    them again once back online. (This is for all the laptop users
    like me who don't want to have to remember which git repos to mr push
    when they come back from a nice long hack in the woods. :-)

mr (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add -q flag.
  * darcs: Add -u to diff to get a more usual unified diff.
  * Add a "record" subcommand, borrowing termonology from darcs. This does a
    local commit, but does not push changes to remote repos.
  * Improve unison support.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 02 Jan 2008 22:49:53 -0500

mr (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support versions of man that don't use -l.
  * Updating git repos no longer uses git-pull -t by default. Git makes it
    to much of a PITA to do this, since -t makes git-pull require the
    repository and refspec be specified at the command line (which is a bug in
    git (#456035). mr used to hardcode those to "origin" and "master", but
    that's not always the right choice. So give up on forcing git to be sane
    about pulling down all tags. It's insane. Live with it, or configure your
    own update command.

mr (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Avoid creating parent directory for a checkout that will ultimately be
    skipped.
  * Don't try to test the repo type when doing a checkout, that can't work
    since the repo isn't there yet. It was actually checking the repo type
    of the parent directory, which caused several unexpected behaviors.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 03 Nov 2007 14:22:00 -0400

mr (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Avoid using commands like git-config and instead use "git config".
    In some configurations, only the main git command is in the path.
  * Allow option bundling, mostly so "-j2" will work.
  * Better error message if more than one repo type test matches a single
    directory.

mr (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split up actions, so each rcs has its own set of action commands,
    and mr tests to see what rcs is used by a repository, and dispatches
    the command.

    This will make it much easier to add new rcses, or modify just the
    command that mr uses for one command for one rcs, without duplicating a
    lot of code, and without needing to modify mr at all.

    The old style unsplit actions are still supported, and are what most
    mrconfig files will still use; this change is fully backwards compatible.
  * Changed some things in the enviroment for the register action.
    It's now run in the directory that the user specifies, and MR_REPO
    is set to contain the basename of the directory that the checkout
    command should check out. These changes should be backware compatible
    to existing register actions.
  * Add info and warning functions to the shell library. (madduck)
  * Add git_bare and git_fake_bare rcs types to handle
    bare and fake bare (non-bare with a detached worktree) git repositories.
    (Diff and commit do not work yet to fake bare repos). (madduck)
  * Add a vim modeline to preserve joey's tabbing prefs. (madduck)
  * Add support for including one mrconfig file from another. Unlike chaining,
    this doesn't change the paths, and is not tied to a particular
    subdirectory. It's useful for loading up library mrconfig files.
  * Split git fake-bare support out into a lib/git-fake-bare.
    Partly because it's a good example of how to add a new revision control
    type and use includes, and partly because it's currently too ugly to be
    in mr itself due to bugs and limitations in git.

mr (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add to the example mrconfig a "tags" command that lists tags.
    (Currently only for svn and git.)
  * hours_since was broken by design, and fixing it involved changing
    its calling convention. If you used the old version, the new version
    will error out.
  * Add ability to reorder repos, if you want mr to act on a given repo first
    or last.

mr (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Removed special case repository deletion handling code. The same
    thing can be accomplished in a mrconfig by skipping a repo unless
    it exists, and printing a reminder on update. See the mrconfig file
    for an example.
  * Fix output of "mr config DEFAULT lib".
  * Change mr update to use git pull -t origin master, to make sure new tags
    are pulled. And since those might not always be the right parameters
    for git pull, any parameters passed to mr update will replace them.

  [ Alexander Wirt ]
  * Add support for mercurial.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Incorporate code based on Anthony Towns's mrs, to allow running
    multiple jobs in parallel. The -j flag controls this.
    This can produce enormous speedups. For me, mr update takes
    12 minutes, while mr -j 10 update takes 1 minute!

mr (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix mr register of a subdir to also work with -c.
  * Signal handling for commands run by mr, including handling of SIGINT
    to stop mr.
  * Ensure parent dirs exist prior to checkout. (madduck)
  * Output list of failed repos to stderr when -s is used.
  * Fix a bug caused by a stupid typo.
  * Add the -n switch, for disabling recursion.
  * Allow for more complex deleted tests, such as marking a repo deleted on
    some hosts, while not on others.
  * Support registering CVS repositories. Closes: #447171
  * MR_CONFIG now points to the config file that contains the repo mr is
    acting on.
  * Make mr register smarter about what mrconfig file to write to.
    (It probably does what you'd expect it to do now; if it doesn't, -c
    can still override.)
