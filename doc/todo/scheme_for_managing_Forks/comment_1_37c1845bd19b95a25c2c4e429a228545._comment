Checkout and set up your additional remote manually for 1 repo, then you can transcribe that into a reusable shell function that uses the MR_REPO envinoment variable (probably `basename`ing it) and a supplied GitHub username. 

Then paste that function into  \"lib =\"  in the [DEFAULT] section of your mrconfig file. Your 27 \"checkout =\" commands can now just call that function rather than doing git commands themselves. 

I do this and so have lots of lines in my mrconfig like:

    [workspace/programming/someproj]
    checkout = cloneGithubForkContributing somegithubuser
