I tried `mr` out on `Bash on Windows`.
I found that `mr` does not work so well.

Steps to reproduce the problem:

```
15:12:57 Andrew@LAPTOP-V9S562AR:~
$ mr s
mr s: /home/Andrew/.config/vcsh/repo.d/author.git
mr s: received signal 127
```
The status action does not cover a number of my repos, it just stops at the first repo.

I have installed `mr` via `sudo apt-get install mr`.
