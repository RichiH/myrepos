Patches accepted.

Although given the cvs status output does not include the directory at all,
except for in some lines output to stderr, which would mean parsing stderr
and combining it with the filenames in stdout to get actual filenames ...
It would be quite a complicated patch.

Of course you can also override `cvs_status` in  your own `.mrconfig`
