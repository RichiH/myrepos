Thank you for the clear error reporting update of `mr`.
The hidden error turns out to be 
```
mr update: failed to execute: Bad file descriptor
```
Now I believe that WSL is responsible for this as it have incomplete Unix filesystem compared to Unix.
Can this `Bad file descriptor` be triggered because `mr` was acting on bad file descriptor number?
