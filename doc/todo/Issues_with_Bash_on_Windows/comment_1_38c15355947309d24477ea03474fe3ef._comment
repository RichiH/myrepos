It seems that, when it tries to run a command that is not available, or
if waiting for the command somehow fails, mr incorrectly interprets
the resulting -1 exit code as a signal 127. I suspect that is what
happened here. I've fixed mr to say "failed to execute" and give the
system error message in this case.

As to why this would happen in WSL, I don't know. Other than WSL not being
a perfect linux system call emulation. Hopefully the above fix will let mr
report what the actual problem is.
