4 years ago, I created <https://github.com/wimleers/mr-drupal>. It still works great. I wrote about it at <http://wimleers.com/article/mr-drupal>.

But this is very hard to discover.

I wonder what other great additions I'm missing out on? If the canonical `myrepos` repo + website would list contributions/extensions, that'd IMHO greatly enhance the ecosystem!

P.S.: thanks again for this excellent tool. A happy user for 4 years now.
