Hi; 
I think that project is absolutely great. However, I was disappointed that symlinks are not supported. I, too, have fallen victim to a $HOME symlink situation, but additionally, my idea of creating a generic symlink-based \"views on my repositories\"-kind of structure vanished before my eyes. I really think this project could need a propper refactoring with respect to resolving symlinks with respect to BOTH path-to-configuration-file and path-to-repository. I am absolutely no good with perl, however, as I learned when trying to fix it myself the last few hours :/

Thank you in any case for the project, because it is a nice help already! however, proper symlink support seems a must-have to me at least for real adaption into my core setup and developing stuff around it.

Cheers!
S.
