I am using `mr` to manage/track repositories for a team which uses one or more github Organisations. It would be nice if mr was able to notice when a new repository was added for a given github organisation, and automatically clone it / add it to the set of locally cloned/tracked repositories. I suppose it could associate a particular local directory path with an Organisation name. Likewise I suppose for other github-style things. I found this simple python script to list all repositories under an organisationhttps://gist.github.com/ralphbean/5733076 which uses a python module pygithub3, I'm guessing there's likely a REST API. -- [Jonathan Dowland](https://jmtd.net/)
