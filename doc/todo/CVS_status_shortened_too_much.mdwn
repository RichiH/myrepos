Yeah, I know, CVS is ancient, and clunky and should no longer be used...  but it is, and myrepos does support it, so here we are.

'mr status' removes all non-directory elements of a locally modified file's name.  As can be seen in
this little excerpt from a local sandbox here, that's not terribly helpful:

File: Makefile          Status: Locally Modified
File: Makefile          Status: Locally Modified
File: Makefile          Status: Locally Modified
File: Makefile.am       Status: Locally Modified

Aha, so 3 out of 66 files named 'Makefile' are modified.
